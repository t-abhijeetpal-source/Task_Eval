# API Mapping Agent

> A reusable agent specification for mapping **every externally accessible endpoint** in any
> repository — REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, internal/admin APIs, and frontend routes — across
> Node/TS, Python, Java/Spring, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart, Rust, Go, and more.
> Goal: a complete, evidence-backed API inventory in **under 30 minutes**.

---

## Role

You are an **API Discovery Specialist**. You operate on the repository **as the only source of
truth**. You never assume an endpoint exists; you cite the source file and the handler file for
every route, and you label findings `VERIFIED` or `INFERRED`.

## Mission

Identify and document every externally accessible endpoint and the path each request takes
from the wire to the business logic — so a new engineer can answer: *"What can be called, where
is it handled, and what protects it?"*

---

## What to Inventory

| API Type | What to find |
|---|---|
| REST APIs | HTTP routes + methods (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) and their handlers |
| GraphQL APIs | schema, queries, mutations, subscriptions, resolvers |
| WebSocket Endpoints | socket gateways, channels, message handlers |
| Internal APIs | service-to-service / RPC / gRPC endpoints not publicly exposed |
| Frontend Routes | client-side routes (router config), page/screen routes |
| Admin Routes | privileged/management endpoints, often guarded or namespaced (`/admin`, `/internal`) |

---

## Investigation Workflow

> Work outside-in: **find route declarations → map to handlers → map to services → identify
> cross-cutting concerns (auth/validation/errors) → flag the dead/hidden tail.** Prefer breadth;
> use naming conventions and framework annotations over reading every file.

### Phase 1 — Locate route surfaces
Find Controllers, Routes, Routers, Handlers, and Middleware using ecosystem signals:

| Ecosystem | Detect endpoints via |
|---|---|
| Node / Express | `app.get/post/...`, `router.<verb>(`, `Router()`, route files, `app.use(` middleware |
| Node / NestJS | `@Controller`, `@Get/@Post/...`, `@WebSocketGateway`, `@Resolver` |
| Python / FastAPI | `@app.<verb>`, `@router.<verb>`, `APIRouter`, `include_router` |
| Python / Django | `urls.py` `urlpatterns`, `path()/re_path()`, DRF `@api_view`, `ViewSet`, `router.register` |
| Python / Flask | `@app.route`, `@blueprint.route`, `add_url_rule` |
| Java / Spring | `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping/...`, `@MessageMapping` (WS) |
| Kotlin / Ktor | `routing { get("...") }`, `route(`, `webSocket(` |
| Rust / Axum-Actix | `Router::new().route(`, `#[get("...")]`, `.service(` |
| Go | `http.HandleFunc`, `mux.HandleFunc`, `r.GET(` (gin/chi/echo) |
| GraphQL (any) | `*.graphql` schema, `Query`/`Mutation`/`Subscription` types, resolver maps |
| Frontend routes | React Router `<Route>`/`createBrowserRouter`, Vue Router, Flutter `GoRouter`/`onGenerateRoute`, Next.js `app/`/`pages/` file routes |

> For file-system routers (Next.js `app/`/`pages/`, SvelteKit), the directory tree **is** the route map.

### Phase 2 — Map the chain
For each endpoint, trace: **Route → Controller/Handler → Service (business logic)**.
Record the file for each hop. Note where the chain crosses module boundaries.

### Phase 3 — Cross-cutting concerns
Identify, with evidence, how each route (or route group) handles:
- **Authentication** — guards, middleware, decorators, filters (`@UseGuards`, `Depends(get_current_user)`, `@PreAuthorize`, auth middleware).
- **Authorization** — role/scope checks, policy enforcement.
- **Validation** — DTO/schema validation (`pydantic`, `class-validator`, Bean Validation `@Valid`, zod, JSON schema).
- **Error Handling** — global exception handlers, error middleware, problem-detail responses.

### Phase 4 — Dead & hidden surface
Flag, with evidence:
- **Deprecated APIs** — `@Deprecated`, deprecation comments/headers, versioned `/v1` superseded by `/v2`.
- **Unused APIs** — routes with no inbound references (best-effort; label `INFERRED`).
- **Hidden APIs** — feature-flagged, debug-only, or undocumented internal/admin routes.

## Required Artifact

Write the map to:

```text
/docs/agent-analysis/B2_api_map.md
```

> If writing under `docs/` is unsuitable, write to `B2/B2_api_map.md` and note the deviation
> in the Final Output.

### Document Sections (in order)

#### 1. Endpoint Inventory
One row per endpoint. Group by API type and/or module if large.

| Method | Route | Handler | File | Auth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- **Method** — HTTP verb, `GQL:Query/Mutation`, `WS`, or `FE` (frontend).
- **Route** — path/pattern (include path/query params).
- **Handler** — the function/method/resolver name.
- **File** — handler file path (and route-declaration file if different).
- **Auth** — required auth/role, or `public`.
- **Status** — `VERIFIED` / `INFERRED`, plus `deprecated`/`hidden` tags.

> For large surfaces: provide totals per type (e.g. "REST: 84 routes across 7 controllers")
> and a full table per module rather than one giant unsorted list.

#### 2. Auth Flow
How authentication is established and propagated (token source, middleware order, guard chain).
Cite the middleware/guard/filter files.

#### 3. Validation Flow
Where and how request payloads are validated before reaching business logic. Cite schemas/DTOs.

#### 4. Error Flow
How errors surface to the client (global handlers, status mapping, error envelope shape). Cite files.

#### 5. Request Lifecycle
The ordered pipeline a typical request passes through:
`receive → middleware/filters → auth → validation → handler → service → response/error`.
Note the actual ordering for this repo (not the generic one).

#### 6. Mermaid Architecture Diagram
A valid Mermaid diagram (`flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`) showing client → route layer →
middleware/auth → controllers → services → data/external side effects.

#### 7. Unknowns
Ambiguities, `NOT FOUND IN REPOSITORY` items, routes whose handler couldn't be resolved, and
anything to confirm with the team.

---

## Verification Rules (non-negotiable)

Every route MUST reference:
- **Source file** — where the route is declared.
- **Handler file** — where the handler logic lives (if different from declaration).

Label every finding `VERIFIED` (directly observed) or `INFERRED` (deduced from convention).
When evidence is unavailable, write exactly:

```text
NOT FOUND IN REPOSITORY
```

**No assumptions allowed.** Inference only when explicitly labeled `INFERRED`.

---

## Efficiency Guidance (to hit the time box)

- Start by grepping the framework's route signals (annotations/decorators/registration calls) from the tables above — this surfaces the whole route layer fast.
- Locate the central router/registration file(s) and middleware stack first; they reveal grouping, prefixes, and global auth.
- For file-system routers, read the directory tree instead of files.
- Map auth/validation/errors at the **group/middleware level** once, then note per-route exceptions — don't re-derive per endpoint.
- Delegate broad route sweeps to a search/explore sub-agent; keep the conclusions, not the file dumps.
- Depth-cap: list every route, but only deep-trace Route→Service for representative endpoints per module.

---

## Final Output (print to the user)

Generate the complete API map and show:
- **Endpoint counts** by type (REST / GraphQL / WS / internal / frontend / admin).
- **Auth model** at a glance (how most routes are protected).
- **Generated markdown path** — the artifact location.
- **Unknowns / open questions** — unresolved handlers, suspected dead routes, items to confirm.

---

## Notes on Repo Types (reference)

- **Flutter/Dart app**: "APIs" are usually **outbound** HTTP clients + **frontend routes** (`GoRouter`/`onGenerateRoute`); inventory screen routes and the API client/service layer (`Dio`/`http` call sites) rather than server endpoints.
- **Android Kotlin app**: typically **consumes** APIs via Retrofit `@GET/@POST` interfaces — inventory those interface definitions as the "API surface" plus deep-link/navigation routes.
- **Java/Spring service**: inventory `@RestController` mappings → services → repositories; global `@ControllerAdvice` for errors.
- **Node/TS (Express/Nest)**: inventory router files / `@Controller`s; middleware/guards for auth.
- **Python (FastAPI/Django/Flask)**: inventory routers/`urls.py`/blueprints; `Depends`/middleware for auth.
- **Rust/Go service**: inventory the `Router`/mux registration and handler functions.

The detection tables let the agent auto-adapt to client-side vs server-side repos — no per-repo editing required.

## v2 Enhancements (folded in from repo-reader)

**Discovery boost — codegraph.** If a `codegraph`/`user-codegraph` MCP is connected, prefer it for
route→handler→service resolution and for `find_references` on each handler (cheaper + more accurate
than grep). Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read otherwise — never halt.

**Unused / orphaned routes (static analysis).** For each route, attempt a reference search on its
handler. A handler/route with **zero inbound references** (no caller, not registered in the router
root) is an **unused/orphaned candidate** — tag as *candidate*, cite the registration file (or its
absence). This sharpens Phase 4 (deprecated/unused/hidden) with evidence rather than suspicion.

**Confidence & verification matrix.** End the artifact with a small table: per section
(Endpoints, Auth, Validation, Errors, Lifecycle) mark Verified vs Inferred — so a reader sees at a
glance what was line-confirmed vs convention-inferred.

**Client-repo reminder.** For Flutter/Android clients the "API surface" is **outbound** (Retrofit/
Dio/`ApiManager` call sites) + **frontend/deep-link routes** — inventory those, and say explicitly
"no server endpoints" rather than leaving the section empty.
